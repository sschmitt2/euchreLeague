### Problem Statement
For the last two years, my friends and I have been playing on a euchre league. The league has grown
tremendously over the last two years, with many new people joining each new season. Currently, we are 
recording the seasons schedule, table information, weekly results, player overall record, and 
current standings on a google doc spreadsheet. 

With the growing trend of the euchre league, I would like to create an application that will store
player, schedule and score data into the database. The application will allow you to add new players and
generate randomized tables where each player must be partners with every player on the league at least 
one time.
